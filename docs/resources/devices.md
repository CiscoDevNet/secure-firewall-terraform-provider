  Resource for adding device in FMC
  Example
  An example is shown below:
  hcl
  resource "fmc_devices" "device1" {
      name = "ftd"
      hostname = "<IP ADDR OF HOST>"
      regkey = "<Reg key used in FTD>"
      license_caps = [
          "MALWARE"
      ]
      access_policy {
          id = data.fmc_access_policies.access_policy.id
      }
  }
  
  Note: If creating multiple rules during a single terraform apply, remember to use depends_on to chain the rules so that terraform creates it in the same order that you intended.
  Note: Please use a depends_on block to create multiple devices from the same plan such that second device only starts registering after device one is finished.

# fmc_devices (Resource)

Resource for adding device in FMC

## Example
An example is shown below: 
```hcl
resource "fmc_devices" "device1" {
    name = "ftd"
    hostname = "<IP ADDR OF HOST>"
    regkey = "<Reg key used in FTD>"
    license_caps = [
		"MALWARE"
    ]
    access_policy {
        id = data.fmc_access_policies.access_policy.id
	}
}
```
**Note:** If creating multiple rules during a single `terraform apply`, remember to use `depends_on` to chain the rules so that terraform creates it in the same order that you intended.
**Note:** Please use a depends_on block to create multiple devices from the same plan such that second device only starts registering after device one is finished.
