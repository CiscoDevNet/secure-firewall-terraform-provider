  Resource for Standard ACL in FMC
  Example
  An example is shown below:
  hcl
  resource "fmc_standard_acl" "acl1" {
      name = "ACL-1"
      action = "DENY"
      object_id = data.fmc_network_objects.any.id
      literal_value = "1.1.1.1"
  }
  
  Note If creating multiple rules during a single terraform apply, remember to use depends_on to chain the rules so that terraform creates it in the same order that you intended.
