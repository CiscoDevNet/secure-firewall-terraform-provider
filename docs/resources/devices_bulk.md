  Resource for adding bulk devices in FMC
  Example
  An example is shown below:
  hcl
  resource "fmc_devices_bulk" "devices" {
      devices {
          name = "ftd"
          hostname = "<IP ADDR OF HOST>"
          regkey = "<Reg key used in FTD>"
          license_caps = [
              "MALWARE"
          ]
          access_policy {
              id = data.fmc_access_policies.access_policy.id
          }
      }
      devices {
          name = "ftd2"
          hostname = "<IP ADDR OF HOST2>"
          regkey = "<Reg key used in FTD2>"
          license_caps = [
              "MALWARE"
          ]
          access_policy {
              id = data.fmc_access_policies.access_policy.id
          }
      }
  }
  
  Note: If creating multiple rules during a single terraform apply, remember to use depends_on to chain the rules so that terraform creates it in the same order that you intended.

# fmc_devices_bulk (Resource)

Resource for adding bulk devices in FMC

## Example
An example is shown below: 
```hcl
resource "fmc_devices_bulk" "devices" {
    devices {
    	name = "ftd"
    	hostname = "<IP ADDR OF HOST>"
    	regkey = "<Reg key used in FTD>"
    	license_caps = [
			"MALWARE"
    	]
    	access_policy {
        	id = data.fmc_access_policies.access_policy.id
		}
	}
    devices {
    	name = "ftd2"
    	hostname = "<IP ADDR OF HOST2>"
    	regkey = "<Reg key used in FTD2>"
    	license_caps = [
			"MALWARE"
    	]
    	access_policy {
        	id = data.fmc_access_policies.access_policy.id
		}
	}
}
```
**Note:** If creating multiple rules during a single `terraform apply`, remember to use `depends_on` to chain the rules so that terraform creates it in the same order that you intended.
